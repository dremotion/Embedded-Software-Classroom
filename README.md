## Overview
When, stumbling across Quora, the question and answer site, I see tons of questions from people curious about career in embedded systems.

There is a simple rule to get a first job in any field: Learn the skills. "Embedded System" is no exception.\
This Classroom, is a free self-taught place to learn embedded systems.


## About Me
My name is Priyank Agarwal, and I'm an Embedded Software Engineer. But I wasn't the same always. I started my career as a Customer Support Associate at Amazon. It is only when I had a need for a job in Embedded Systems, I searched for guidance.  Once I gained the skills, I got my first job at a very cool startup. [My LinkedIn Profile][28]\
If I could do it, with right guidance and support, I believe anyone can.\
The classroom can help you with the right path but for motivation you'll have to do some introspection. 


## About Course
To quickly categorize, Embedded Systems have multiple roles like: Hardware Designer, Firmware Engineers, QA Engineers...blah.blah.blah....\
Each role has different experts and requires different set of skillsets.\
This class trains you in embedded software/firmware. If you're interested in making a career in embedded software or you're a beginner and just want to play around, this classroom is great place to start.



## Prerequisites & Procedure
Embedded Systems can't be learned without working on actual devices. Some of the courses in the curriculum, will require you to make projects which will require you to buy devices(like a Raspberry pi) and work on them. Sadly, simply keeping the devices won't teach you.
During the courses, there'll be times, you'll encounter an unheard concept. You'll have to do some reserach and understand the concept. You can use the forums listed below for help. \
I'll recommend taking the courses in the order as listed. There would still be a lot of new terms, but I've tried to select and list courses in an order, so that their quantity is reduced.


## Curriculum
The curriculum is extracted by referencing two popular Embedded Training institutes in India: CDAC and Vector India Pvt Ltd and is divided into three modules: Basic, Advanced, Additional.
  - [Basic](#Basic)
    - Programming With C
    - Embedded System Basics
    - Compilers
    - MicroControllers
    - Debugging Tools
  - [Advanced](#Advanced)
    - Operating Systems
    - MicroProcessors
    - RTOS
  - [Additional](#Additional)
    - IoT and Protocols
    - Matlab
    - C++
    - Python
    - Node.Js


## Let's Begin The Class
Just one last thing. Basic and advanced modules are mandatory(no skipping) to get that job in embedded software. You might get one with just the Basic courses but you'll have to be somewhat lucky for that. Always remember that **the motive isn't just to get the job but to be so skillful that you get the job**. No cheating. If you'd like to study more, you can explore additional modules.

## To Do
- Adding relevant courses
- Increasing efficiency of courses: Due to uncustomized courses, some information is repeated while some is missed. Increased homework for students
- Adding details to remaining sections of readme
- Removal of youtube links from curriculum
